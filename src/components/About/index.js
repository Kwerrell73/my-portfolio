    the
    worldwide pandemic in 2020, I was placed on furlough.Over the past year, I've worked diligently to build
    my
    technical
    skillset.I'm currently studying Full Stack Development, with focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Kubernetes
    and
    Docker. It's my dream to rebuild my career as a successful
    developer.
